We do not claim any ownership of the game, and by using software in any form, you are agreeing that you own a legitimate copy of the game (sorry for the legalese, I'd rather not get sued). You may find the game [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/). If you wish to add to the project, please do so! Create a local fork, and make a pull request!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/omni-/isaac-injector.git \r\n$ cd isaac-injector\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Mac, I'm sorry. So far we only support Windows.\r\n\r\n### How do I work this thing?\r\nMy best advice to you would be to slowly sift through the source. The C++ end can be especially hard to understand, since there are a lot of WinAPI calls and other low level stuff. Basically the C++ DLL is injected by the .NET console app. The DLL waits for the game to hit certain addresses in memory, then raises events back to the .NET app. A high-level wrapper around the whole thing in .NET allows for custom plugin development without months of research on the topic.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Reading \r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking\r\n* https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Signature_scanning\r\n* http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c/72416-simplest-function-hooking-ida-detours-and-c.html\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Project lead/executive developer - @omni-\r\n* Project lead/executive developer - @Cjreek\r\n* Developer - @DorgenEdge\r\n* Developer - @adewey\r\n* Special thanks to - @UnderscoreKilburn\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nfirst and foremost, create an issue on github. \r\nIf that doesn't work, email us at `support@code-cast.net` or `isaac-injector@code-cast.net`.\r\nIf even that fails, look for `omnichroma` on Steam.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
