# isaac-injector 
isaac-injector is a project dedicated to modding The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth through dynamic code injection. Thank you for using Omni's Modloader (OML).

### Installation Instructions
* Extract to a folder somewhere.
* Run 'omni's modloader.exe'. (**NOTE:** because of the nature of the modloader, some antivriuses may think it's malicious. Don't worry, it isn't :)


### Troubleshooting
If the executable crashes on startup with NotSupportedException, please right-click on ALL THE DLLS (including the ones in the Plugins folder) and select "Unblock". 

For any other problems, please try the following steps

* Download vcredist (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
* Close the game, OML, and Steam and try again.
* If that doesn't fix it, please submit a support ticket on the GitHub page (https://github.com/omni-/isaac-injector/issues).
